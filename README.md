# Bluegrammer

Bluegrammer is a modified version of [Brogrammer](https://github.com/kenwheeler/brogrammer-theme). 
I just blue the brogrammer and cleaned it up a bit

I also included a modified Monokai color scheme, which I prefer more than Brogrammer's color scheme

## Install

### Via Package Control

NOT IMPLEMENTED
~~Theme is listed as `Theme - Brogrammer` in Will Bond's [Sublime Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net).~~
